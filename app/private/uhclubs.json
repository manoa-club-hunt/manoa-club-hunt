Student leaders engage others in thoughtful and meaningful discussion as well as deep and long-lasting relationships for peace and growth.\nWe believe that the ideal is created within and practiced in daily habits. We study and research these ideals and principles taught by great role models and teachers in every field throughout history. \nAfter study, we practice. Change doesn’t happen overnight but rather incrementally through daily, consistent effort. That’s what we practice. CARP offers a loving environment for students to encourage growth. "

    "description": "Chi Epsilon is the National Civil Engineering Honor Society.  We are dedicated to maintaining and promoting the status of civil engineering as an ideal profession here on the UHM campus.  To contribute to the improvement of the profession, Chi Epsilon fosters the development and exercise of sound traits of character and technical ability among civil engineers, and its members, by precept and example, toward an ever higher standard of professional service.  We provide tutoring in lower-level CEE courses, commit ourselves frequently to community service events, offer career development opportunities for our members, and host social events.\n\nChi Epsilon was organized to recognize the characteristics of the individual civil engineer deemed to be fundamental to the successful pursuit of an engineering career, and to aid in the development of those characteristics in the civil engineering student.  Membership into Chi Epsilon is by invitation only (see our Membership Requirement section for more info).  Our membership is largely comprised of undergraduates with 20 current members, but membership is open to graduate students as well.  Our program emphasizes the four pillars of Chi Epsilon: Scholarship, Practicability, Sociability, and Character."

With diverse groups of students coming together, the Hawai'i Cru movement uses a mixture of resources that allows our leaders to reach students effectively.  As a movement we are excited to continue to send students to conferences and mission trips headed by all the different networks of the campus ministries of Cru."

That was to provide a support system for international students attending the University of Hawai’i. Through these years, International Student leaders came together foster the common goals which were finally written down in its first constitution in 1999. This constitution established an operating framework for the organization and is still followed to this day. In 2003, PALS members voted to re-name itself as the International Student Association.\n\nIn 1998, a group of international students hosted a luncheon for June Naughton upon her retirement as director of the ISS. The students asked her to volunteer and start an organization that would benefit international students during their studies at the University of Hawaii. Knowing that leadership experience and intercultural communication were critical any successful international organization, the first few years of PALS focused on building these qualities among the members. When the members developed a variety of leadership experiences and the organizational mission was better defined, the name changed from Peer Advocate Leadership Society (PALS)  to International Student Association  (ISA) to attract a more diversified group of students seeking international contacts and experiences."
